Since I don't know how to do a "proper" .deb release, I decided to use
PyPackager (http://khertan.net/softwares/pypackager.php).  This runs on
the Nokia Internet Tablet and takes in a "Source Folder" directory.
In the "debian" directory you will find "xword.pypackager".  Open this file
with PyPackager.  You will need to change the "Source Folder" to point to
the directory ".../xword/trunk/usr".  Then you can build the .deb.
