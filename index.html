    <p>
    xword is a crossword puzzle program for the Nokia Internet Tablet
    (NIT) which can read <a href="http://www.litsoft.com/">Across
    Lite</a> ".puz" files.
    It is written in <a
      href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> using <a
      href="http://www.pygtk.org/">pyGTK</a>.  It is based on the <a
      href="http://x-word.org/">original Xword program</a> written by Bill
    McCloskey.  The NIT version fixes a few bugs in the original code and
    adds functionality (e.g. built-in keyboard) to make the program more
    usable on the NIT.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before you go any farther, you should be aware of the following
    caveats.
    <ul>
    <li>The program is <b>sloooow</b>.  It is basically one very long
    python script.  On the NIT with large crossword puzzles, there is
    a noticeable delay between input and screen update.  Fortunately,
    inputs are queued so that you don't have to wait for the screen to
    update before entering the next letter.
    </li>
    <li>The program has been tested with OS2006, OS2007, and OS2008, so it
    should run on any Nokia Internet Tablet, including the 770. The
    program depends upon the following libraries: python2.5, python2.5-gtk2, 
    python2.5-hildon, and python2.5-osso.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <a name="installing"><h1>installing xword</h1></a>
    <p>
    The xword program and the python libraries are available from the <a
    href="http://repository.maemo.org/extras/">maemo extras</a>
    repository.  Go into the Application Manager, select the menu
    "Tools-&gt;Application catalog..." and verify that "maemo Extras"
    is not grayed out.  If it is, select "maemo Extras", click the
    "Edit" button, and uncheck the "Disabled" checkbox.  Then click
    "OK", and then "Close".  Let the Application Manager reread the
    catalog list.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now, click on "Browse installable applications" and then on "All".
    Scroll to the bottom and install "xword".  If the program does
    not install correctly, you may need to <a
    href="http://maemo.org/community/wiki/ApplicationManagerRedPillMode/">enable
    Red Pill mode</a>.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Alternatively, you can open an xterm and
    install everything manually as root.  To do this, make sure the
    maemo extras repository is enabled, then run the following commands 
    in a terminal.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <code>
        sudo gainroot<br/>
        apt-get install xword
      </code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    The xword program will appear in your program menu somewhere, probably
    "Extras".  The first time you start xword, you will need to open a
    ".puz" crossword puzzle.  The ".puz" format was created for <a
      href="http://www.litsoft.com/across/alite/download.htm">Across
      Lite</a>.  Puzzles in this format can be found around the net.  
      The <a
      href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/crosswords/index.html">New York
      Times</a> provides a <a
      href="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/puzzles/classic.puz">free 
      classic puzzle</a>.  The <a
    href="http://www.chron.com/entertainment/games/">Houston Chronicle</a>
    also has a <a
    href="http://www.chron.com/apps/games/xword/puzzles/">two week archive
    of free puzzles</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    In general, tap the box you want to move to.  That box will appear in
    red.  The rest of that word will appear in gray to indicate the
    direction of the word.  The clue for that word will appear above the
    puzzle.  Tap the box again to change word direction from horizontal to
    vertical (or back).  Type in letters to fill in the word.

        mistakes found".  Otherwise, you will be shown a pop-up window
        saying "Incorrect" and the incorrect squares will be marked with a

            marked with a small red triangle in the corner to keep track of

        </li>
        <li><b>Clear &gt;</b> - Clear the letter(s) and any error marks for
        the current item.  This allows you to "cheat" by removing all black
        and red triangles showing the letters you needed help with.  
        <blockquote>

    <p>
    <b>Preferences</b>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Skip Filled</b> - Toggle a checkmark for if you want to skip
        boxes where you have already filled in a letter.  This can reduce
        the number of letters you have to type in.
        </li>
        <li><b>Minimum Box Size...</b> - Bring up a dialog allowing you to set
        the minimum box size of each letter square.  The default size is 20
        which allows a 21x21 puzzle to fit full screen without scrollbars.
        You can set this value between 12 and 40 inclusive.
        </li>
        <li><b>Solution Buttons &gt;</b> - Set the location of the
        check/solve buttons.  The default is "off".  Alternatively, you can
        show them on any side of the screen.  You are given buttons to
        conveniently "Check/Solve" a "Letter/Word", as well as a timer
        button.
        </li>
        <li><b>Onscreen Keyboard &gt;</b> - Set the location of the onscreen
        keyboard.  The default is "off".  Alternatively, you can show it on
        any side of the screen.  The keyboard has the letters A-Z as well as
        some extra buttons to aid in cursor movement.  There are also two
        "Check/Solve" buttons and a timer button.  The "Check/Solve" buttons
        check/solve the current word when clicked.  However, these buttons
        also support "tap-and-hold" which brings up a pop-up menu to
        check/solve the current letter, word, or puzzle.
        </li>
        <li><b>Word List Layout &gt;</b> - The "word list" is the list of
        horizontal and vertical clues.  The default is to show only the
        puzzle.  Alternatively, you can show the word list on the left,
        right, top, bottom, or some combination of these.

    So you want to solve crosswords on your home computer?  Well, you could
    simply download <a
      href="http://www.litsoft.com/across/alite/download.htm">Across
      Lite</a> for your platform.  Or you can use the same xword
    program that runs on your NIT on any computer that supports <a
      href="http://www.python.org/">python</a>, <a
      href="http://www.pygtk.org/">pyGTK</a>, and <a
      href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Follow the installation instructions appropriate for your platform
    for <a
      href="http://www.python.org/download/">python</a>, <a
      href="http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html">pyGTK</a>, and <a
      href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">subversion</a>.
    Then download the latest xword code from the <a
      href="https://garage.maemo.org/">maemo garage</a> using the following
    command.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <code>
      svn checkout https://garage.maemo.org/svn/xword/trunk/
    </code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Change into the newly created "<tt>trunk/</tt>" directory and run the
    "<tt>xword</tt>" program you find there.  For Windows, you may need to
    rename "<tt>xword</tt>" to "<tt>xword.py</tt>" to be able to run it by
    double-clicking.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <a name="trouble"><h1>troubleshooting</h1></a>
    <p>
    The program maintains two special hidden files/directories in your home
    directory.  The "<tt>.crossword.cfg</tt>" file maintains the
    configuration settings for the program.  The "<tt>.crossword_puzzles</tt>"
    directory holds the current state for all .puz files you have opened in
    the past.  If you ever have any problems starting the program or
    (re)opening a .puz file, you may need to delete these files/directories.
    To do so, open an xterm and type the following command.
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre>
        rm  -rf  ~/.crossword.cfg  ~/.crossword_puzzles/</pre>

      <li>There is limited support for "locked" puzzles.  You cannot use any

      However, you can solve the puzzle on your own.  When an unlocked
      version of the puzzle comes out, you can continue your partially
