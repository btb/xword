    <a name="about"><h1>about</h1></a>
    <p>
    xword is a crossword puzzle program for the Nokia Internet Tablet which
    can read <a href="http://www.litsoft.com/">Across Lite</a> .puz files.
    It is written in <a
      href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> using <a
      href="http://www.pygtk.org/">pyGTK</a>.  It is based on the <a
      href="http://x-word.org/">original Xword program</a> written by Bill
    McCloskey.  The NIT version fixes a few bugs in the original code and
    adds some functionality (e.g. built-in keyboard) to make the
    program more usable on the NIT.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before you go any farther, you should be aware of the following
    caveats.
    <ul>
      <li>The program is <b>sloooow</b>.  It is basically one very long
      python script.  On the NIT, there is sometimes a one second delay
      between input and screen update.  Fortunately, touchscreen inputs are
      queued so that you don't have to wait for the screen to update before
      entering the next letter.
    </li>
    <li>The program has been tested only on OS2008 (i.e. the N800 and N810).
    The .deb requires python2.5 and python2.5-gtk2.  It is possible that the
    program would run with 2.4 versions, but it has not been tested.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <a name="installing"><h1>installating xword</h1></a>
    <p>
    To install xword on your N8x0, you need to install python2.5 and
    python2.5-gtk.  These are available in the <a
      href="http://repository.maemo.org/extras/">maemo extras</a>
    repository.  Go into the Application Manager, select the menu
    "Tools-&gt;Application catalog..." and verify that "maemo Extras" is not
    grayed out.  If it is, select "maemo Extras", click the "Edit" button,
    and uncheck the "Disabled" checkbox.  Then click "OK", and then "Close".
    Let the Applciation Manager reread the catalog list.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now, <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=620">install the
      latest vesion of the xword.deb file</a>.  If the program does not
    automatically install, you may need to open an xterm and install
    everything manually as root.  So SAVE the latest xword.deb to your NIT
    and then run the following commands in a terminal.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <code>
        sudo gainroot<br/>
        sudo apt-get install python2.5 python2.5-gtk2<br/>
        dpkg -i /home/user/xword-x.x.x.deb
      </code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Be sure to change the "xword-x.x.x.deb" file to the correct file
    name.
    </p>

    The xword program will appear in your program menu somewhere, probably
    "Extras".  The first time you start xword, you will need to open a
    ".puz" crossword puzzle.  The ".puz" format was created for <a
      href="http://www.litsoft.com/across/alite/download.htm">Across
      Lite</a>.  Puzzles in this format can be found around the net.  <a
      href="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/puzzles/classic.puz">HERE</a> is
    a free "classic" puzzle from the <a
    href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/crosswords/index.html">New York
    Times</a>.  The <a
    href="http://www.chron.com/entertainment/games/">Houston Chronicle</a>
    also has a <a
    href="http://www.chron.com/apps/games/xword/puzzles/">selection of free
    puzzles</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    In general, tap the box you want to move to.  That box will appear in
    red.  The rest of that word will appear in gray to indicate the
    direction of the word.  The clue for that word will appear above the
    puzzle.  Tap the box again to change word direction from horizontal to
    vertical (or back).  Type in letters to fill in the word.

        <li><b>Save</b> - Save the state of the current puzzle.  This is
        not strictly necessary since the state of the puzzle gets saved
        automatically when you exit the program.
        </li>
        <li><b>Properties...</b> - Show the properties of the current
        puzzle.  This includes the title, author, and copyright information.

    <b>Puzzle</b>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Check Word</b> - Check the current word for correctness.  If
        the word is correct, you will be shown a popup window saying "No
        mistakes found".  Otherwise, you will be shown a popup window saying
        "Incorrect" and the incorrect letters will be marked with a big "X"
        through them as well as a small black triangle in the corner to keep
        track of the letters you needed help with.
        </li>
        <li><b>Check Puzzle</b> - Perform "Check Word" on all currently
        filled in words.  Thus, the puzzle does not need to be complete to
        check it.
        </li>
        <li><b>Solve Word</b> - Fill in the correct letters for the current
        word.  The letters that get filled in by the application will be
        marked with a small red triangle in the corner to keep track of the
        letters you needed help with.
        </li>
        <li><b>Clear Puzzle</b> - Completely clear the current puzzle and
        start from scratch.

    <p>
    <b>Preferences</b>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Skip Filled</b> - Toggle a checkmark for if you want to skip
        boxes where you have already filled in a letter.  This can reduce
        the number of letters you have to type in.
        </li>
        <li><b>Set Min Box Size</b> - Bring up a dialog allowing you to set
        the minimum box size of each letter square.  The default size is 20
        which allows a 21x21 puzzle to fit fullscreen without scrollbars.
        You can set this value between 12 and 40 inclusive.
        </li>
        <li><b>Toolbar Layout</b> - Set the location of the "toolbar".  The
        toolbar can be turned off entirely to maximize screen real estate.
        You can show the "Check" buttons, which duplicate the functionality
        of the "Puzzle" menu above AND provide a clock timer.  Or you can
        show the "Keyboard" which allows you to enter letters and duplicates
        some functionality of the hardware buttons.  The toolbar can be
        shown on the left or right side of the screen.
        </li>
        <li><b>Word List Layout</b> - The "word list" is the list of
        horizontal and vertical clues.  The default is to show only the
        puzzle.  Alternatively, you can show the word list on the left,
        right, top, bottom, or some combination of these.

    <h2>hardware buttons</h2>

    For convenience, the harware buttons on the NIT duplicate some of the

    The on-screen keyboard allows you to enter letters for those devices
    without a hardware keyboard (e.g. the N800).  In addition to letters,
    there are some special buttons near the bottom as shown in the image

    So you want to solve crosswords on your home computer?  Well, you could
    simply download <a
      href="http://www.litsoft.com/across/alite/download.htm">Across
      Lite</a> for your platform.  But you can also use the same xword
    program that runs on your NIT on any computer that supports <a
      href="http://www.python.org/">python</a>, <a
      href="http://www.pygtk.org/">pyGTK</a>, and <a
      href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Follow the installation instructions appropriate for your platform
    for <a
      href="http://www.python.org/download/">python</a>, <a
      href="http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html">pyGTK</a>, and <a
      href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">subversion</a>.
    Then download the latest xword code from the <a
      href="https://garage.maemo.org/">maemo garage</a> using the following
    command.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <code>
      svn checkout https://garage.maemo.org/svn/xword/trunk/root/
    </code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Change into the newly created "<tt>usr/bin/</tt>" directory and run the
    "<tt>xword</tt>" program you find there.  For Windows, you may need to
    rename "<tt>xword</tt>" to "<tt>xword.py</tt>" to be able to run it by
    double-clicking.

    Please report bugs to the <a
      href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/xword">xword on maemo
      team</a>.  Here are some known bugs.
    <ol>
      <li>If you attempt to open a file that is NOT an Across Lite .puz
      file, the File Open dialog box will not go away requiring you to kill
      the program (through some other mechanism).  Also, the bad file may be
      written to your configuration settings file, preventing you from
      running the program again.  To fix this, remove the
      "<tt>.crossword.cfg</tt>" file in your home directory.
      </li>
      <li>If you attempt to open a .puz file containing Across Lite Notepad
      data, the file will open, but will not show the correct puzzle size.
      You will probably get a bunch of extra words with blank answers.  It
      is possible to solve the puzzle, but very inconvenient.
      </li>
      <li>There is limited support for "locked" puzzles.  You cannot use the
      "check word", "solve word", or "check puzzle" functions since the
      answers are encrypted.  However, you can solve the puzzle on your own.
      When an unlocked version of the puzzle comes out, you can continue
      your partially filled in puzzle and then use the "check" functions.
      </li>
